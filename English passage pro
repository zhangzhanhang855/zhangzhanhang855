The Last Gift
(A True Story of Love, Growth, and Memory)
When I was in my first year of high school, I used to think that life was simple. I thought people came and went, and that time could wash away everything — joy, pain, even love. But everything changed because of one person — my grandfather. The memory of that winter with him has stayed in my heart ever since, and it became the story that shaped who I am today.
Part One: The Winter Morning
It was a cold morning in December. The first snow of the year had fallen during the night, and the world outside was covered with a soft white blanket. I was sitting by the window, watching snowflakes dance in the wind, when my mother came into my room.
She said quietly, “Grandpa is in the hospital again. We’re going to visit him.”
I froze. Grandpa had been sick for months, and I knew he was getting weaker. I didn’t say anything, just nodded and went to get dressed.
On the way to the hospital, the world outside the car window looked cold and gray. I leaned my head against the glass, my breath fogging it up. My mother sat silently beside me, holding a thermos of hot soup.
When we arrived, I could smell disinfectant in the hospital corridor. Grandpa was lying in bed, his face pale, but his eyes were still bright when he saw me. “Ah, my little scholar is here,” he said with a smile.
“Grandpa,” I said softly, holding his hand. It felt cold and thin, like paper.
He patted my hand and said, “Don’t worry about me. I’m fine. Tell me about your school.”
So I told him about my exams, my friends, and the funny things that had happened recently. He listened carefully, smiling the whole time. When I finished, he said, “You’ve grown up so fast. Remember, no matter what happens, be kind, be strong, and never stop learning.”
I nodded, trying to smile back, but my eyes were wet.
Before we left, he asked me to open the drawer beside his bed. Inside was an old notebook with a brown leather cover. He handed it to me and said, “This is for you. I started writing it when you were born. It’s my last gift.”
I took it with trembling hands. The cover was worn, but it smelled faintly of ink and time. I didn’t know then how much it would mean to me later.
Part Two: The Day Everything Changed
A week later, Grandpa passed away.
The news came on another cold morning. I remember my mother’s voice breaking when she said the words. The world suddenly felt silent. I couldn’t believe it. I had thought he would recover, that I would still see his smile again.
At the funeral, I stood by his photo. He looked peaceful, just like always. Everyone was crying, but I couldn’t. My heart felt empty.
That night, I sat alone in my room and opened the notebook he had given me. Inside, his handwriting filled every page — neat, steady, full of warmth. The first page said:
“For my dear grandson — so you will remember where you come from, and never forget to look up at the stars.”
I turned the pages slowly. Some entries were simple, like “Today he learned to walk” or “He called me Grandpa for the first time.” Others were longer — his thoughts about life, his hopes for me.
One entry caught my eye:
“When he grows up, he will face many choices. I hope he chooses to be good, even when it’s hard. Because goodness is the light that keeps us human.”
Reading his words, I finally cried. I cried for the first time since he left, for all the things I wanted to say but never did. That night, I fell asleep with the notebook in my arms.
Part Three: The Lesson of the Notebook
In the weeks after his death, I started reading a few pages of the notebook every night. It felt like he was still talking to me — teaching me lessons about patience, honesty, and courage.
One story he wrote stayed in my mind forever.
He wrote about when he was young, working in the countryside. One winter, there was a poor family living nearby. They had no firewood and no food. Though his own family was struggling, he secretly brought them rice and wood at night so they wouldn’t starve. When his father found out, he didn’t scold him. Instead, he said, “A man is measured not by what he owns, but by what he gives.”
When I read that line, I realized why Grandpa was always respected by everyone. He didn’t live a rich life, but he lived a good one.
That winter, inspired by him, I started volunteering at a community center near my school. We visited elderly people who lived alone and helped them clean their rooms or talk with them. At first, I did it just to honor Grandpa. But soon, I began to understand why he cared so much about kindness.
One old lady there, Auntie Li, once held my hand and said, “You remind me of my grandson. He lives far away, but you make me feel less lonely.”
That moment warmed my heart. For the first time, I felt the joy of giving — the same joy Grandpa must have felt when he helped others.
Part Four: The Promise
Months passed, and I kept Grandpa’s notebook on my desk. Before every exam, I would read a few pages. His words gave me strength whenever I felt tired or lost.
Then came the hardest moment of that year — the school’s speech contest. The theme was “The Person Who Changed My Life.” I wanted to talk about Grandpa, but I was nervous. I had never spoken in front of so many people before.
The night before the contest, I sat at my desk, staring at the notebook. I whispered, “Grandpa, what should I do?”
Then I turned to the last page. There were only a few words, written shakily but full of love:
“Don’t be afraid of life. Even when I am gone, my love stays in your heart. Speak with courage — your voice is my voice.”
The next day, I went on stage. My hands were shaking, but when I looked at the audience, I thought of Grandpa’s smile. I took a deep breath and began to speak.
I told the story of the notebook, of the man who had taught me the meaning of kindness and courage. My voice trembled at first, but as I continued, I felt calm — as if he were standing beside me, nodding gently.
When I finished, there was silence for a moment, then applause. I saw my mother wiping her eyes in the crowd.
I didn’t care whether I would win or not. That day, I had kept my promise — to speak with courage, to carry his light forward.
Part Five: Years Later
It’s been several years since that winter. I am in college now, studying education. I chose this path because I want to become a teacher — just like Grandpa once was.
Sometimes, when I feel tired from studying, I open that old notebook again. The pages are yellow now, the ink fading, but the words still shine like stars.
Each time I read them, I remember his voice, his laughter, his stories. And I remember the lessons he left behind — to be kind, to give, to believe in the power of small acts.
People often ask me why I keep that old notebook instead of putting it away safely. I always tell them, “Because it’s not just paper — it’s the heartbeat of my childhood.”
I still carry his last message with me:
“The best gift you can give to the world is to live with love.”
So I try. I help others when I can, I study hard, and I face life with gratitude. Every winter, when the first snow falls, I stand by the window, just like that morning years ago, and whisper softly, “Thank you, Grandpa.”
He may be gone, but his love never left. It lives in every good thing I try to do, in every person I choose to help, in every dream I dare to chase.
Part Six: What I Learned
Looking back, I realize that the greatest gifts in life are not money, success, or fame. They are the lessons and love that people leave behind.
Grandpa taught me that even when people die, their spirit stays alive through the kindness they gave. His notebook became my guide — a small, silent voice reminding me who I want to be.
Now, whenever I face difficulties, I ask myself, “What would Grandpa do?” And the answer is always simple: “Do good. Be brave. Never stop learning.”
That is his last gift — not just a book of memories, but a map for my life.
